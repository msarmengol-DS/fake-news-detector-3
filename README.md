## Introduction

This project aims to detect fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Fake news is a pressing issue in today's digital age, where misinformation can spread rapidly and have serious consequences. By leveraging NLP, we can develop a system that can help identify potentially misleading or false information in news articles and social media content.

## Project Overview

The project consists of several components:

1. **Data Collection**: We gather a dataset of news articles, including both real and fake news, to train and test our model.

2. **Preprocessing**: We preprocess the text data by removing stopwords, tokenizing, and performing other text cleaning operations.

3. **Feature Extraction**: We extract relevant features from the text data, such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and word embeddings.

4. **Model Development**: We build and train an NLP model using various machine learning or deep learning techniques to classify news articles as either real or fake.

5. **Evaluation**: We evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Web Application**: Optionally, we can create a web application or API for users to input news articles and receive a fake news detection result.

## Installation

This project uses

- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install .
```

You can also install them using `poetry`:

```bash
poetry install
```

## Usage

### üêã Using Docker

This project provides a docker-compose.yml file to run the project in a docker container. To run the project in a docker container, follow these steps:

```bash
docker-compose up
``````

### Using Python

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd fake-news-detection
```

3. Follow the instructions in the project's README to run the code, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is a crucial component. It typically includes a collection of news articles labeled as real or fake. You can find such datasets on platforms like Kaggle, or you can curate your own. Make sure you have a training and testing dataset with ground truth labels for your model.

## Algorithm

The choice of algorithm depends on your project requirements and dataset. Common algorithms for text classification tasks like fake news detection include:

- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**

You can experiment with different algorithms and fine-tune hyperparameters to achieve the best results.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is assessed through various metrics, including:

- Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified articles.
- Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions.
- Recall: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positive instances.
- F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to classify real and fake news accurately.
